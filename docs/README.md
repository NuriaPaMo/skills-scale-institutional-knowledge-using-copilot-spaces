# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This collection of documents describes the processes, workflows, and best practices that guide how we deliver projects at OctoAcme.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is rooted in clarity of roles, structured workflows, and iterative delivery. Projects are initiated with a strong emphasis on defining business needs, stakeholder alignment, and measurable outcomes. The Project Manager (PM) coordinates delivery, risks, and communication, while the Product Manager (PdM) owns the product vision, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success. Developers, QA/testers, and stakeholders each play concrete roles in ensuring that features are implemented, validated, and delivered in line with acceptance criteria and user value.

Key workflows are standardized through documented processes for project initiation, planning, execution, risk management, release, and retrospectives. Work begins with a Project One-pager to clarify objectives and stakeholders, followed by planning sessions that break work into prioritized backlogs and release milestones. Execution is tracked via project boards (with stages like Backlog, In Progress, QA, Done) and reinforced by daily standups, weekly syncs, and scheduled demos. Risk management is embedded throughout, with a risk register maintained and reviewed regularly, and clear escalation paths for blockers and incidents.

Communication is a central pillar, with regular cadences established: daily or twice-weekly standups, weekly PM/PdM syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalation channels. Templates for status updates and incident communications ensure transparency and timely information flow across technical and business teams. All key artifacts, decisions, and status updates are documented and shared in accessible formats, reducing dependency on any single team member and accelerating onboarding.

Quality assurance is built into every stage of the process. Automated tests, code reviews, and CI checks are required for all pull requests, complemented by manual QA and smoke tests before releases. Retrospectives after each milestone promote a culture of continuous improvement, with action items tracked and reviewed to ensure learnings are applied in future work. This disciplined yet adaptable framework enables OctoAcme teams to deliver reliable outcomes, respond quickly to change, and maintain alignment from inception through delivery and beyond.
