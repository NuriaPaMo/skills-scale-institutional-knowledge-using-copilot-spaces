- QA sign-off from QA Lead (all test cases passed, no critical bugs)
- UX validation for user-facing changes (UX Designer sign-off)
- Release notes drafted (coordinated by Release Manager with Technical Writer)
- Rollback / mitigation plan documented (Release Manager)
- Smoke tests prepared and reviewed (QA Lead)
- Documentation updated (Technical Writer)
- Stakeholder communication prepared (see [Stakeholder Communications Template](stakeholder-communications-template.md))
