# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Include: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA Lead, UX Designer, Stakeholder Representatives
   - Reference: [Role Onboarding Template](role-onboarding-template.md) for new team members
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
   - Product Manager leads with input from UX Designer and Stakeholder Representatives
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - Developers lead estimation with QA Lead input for testing effort
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - Include QA criteria from QA Lead, design validation from UX Designer
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
   - Technical Writer identifies documentation needs; Release Manager identifies deployment dependencies
6. Create release plan and milestone map
   - Release Manager coordinates release scheduling
